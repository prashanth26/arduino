# [Paul McWhorter Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGs0VKk2DiYw-L-RibttcvK-WBZm8WLEP) Notes

## Arduino Tutorial 1: Setting Up and Programming the Arduino for Absolute Beginners
- Download Arduino IDE from [https://www.arduino.cc/](https://www.arduino.cc/)
- Try a simple light blinking program on port 13

## Arduino Tutorial 2: Understanding How Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) Work
- LED works as P and N semi conductor
- Only one side
- Long Side (P) - connect to postive
- Short Side (N) - connect to negative

## Arduino Tutorial 3: Understanding How Breadboards Work
- Always use 330 ohm resistance in series with LED of 5V

## Arduino Tutorial 4: Understanding Arduino Variables
- Always use variables instead of literals (strings, numbers)

## Arduino Tutorial 5: Understanding and Working With Binary Numbers
- Anything in the world can be represent as a numbers
- Numbers are then converted into binary

## Arduino Tutorial 6: Build an LED Binary Counter
- All negatives/ground are the same
- Ground can be shared

## Arduino Tutorial 7: Understanding the Arduino Analog Write Command
- You can adjust analog signals from 0-255
- setup() - `pinMode(redPin, OUTPUT)`
- loop() - `analogWrite(redPin, 255)`
